# Image Encryption Tool

## Overview

This project is an image encryption tool developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The tool enables users to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques, enhancing data security.

## Features

- Encrypts images by shifting pixel values.
- Decrypts images to restore original content.
- Demonstrates functionality using a picture of OMEN, a character from Valorant by Riot Games.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Pillow numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Update the image paths in the script with the appropriate paths for your input and output images.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python pixel.py
   ```

## Example

The script uses an image named `OMEN.jpg` for encryption and creates `encrypted.jpg` and `decrypted.jpg` as outputs.
